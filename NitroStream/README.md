# NitroStream
Allows you to stream upto source resolution and 60fps without having Nitro in any form.

# How does this work?
Discord does no serverside stream quality check. So, just modifying the client and changing the premiumType can allow you to stream at a higher quality. This will probably be patched soon,
so use it while you still can.
