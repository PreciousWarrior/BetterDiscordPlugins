# NitroStream

# Alert
This plugin allows you to stream at a higher definition than should be possible, and thus Discord might detect and store this information. If they do, it could result in **your account getting banned**. Personally, I do not use this plugin because I find it to be too risky. I would recommend using this on an account you don't care about, or not using it at all.

Allows you to stream upto source resolution and 60fps without having Nitro in any form.

# How does this work?
Discord does no serverside stream quality check. So, just modifying the client and changing the premiumType can allow you to stream at a higher quality. This will probably be patched soon,
so use it while you still can.
